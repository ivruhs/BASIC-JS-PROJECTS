            <h3>1. Objective of the Game</h3>
            <p>
              The goal of the game is to get a hand value as close to
              <span class="highlight">21</span> as possible, without going over.
              If the total value of your cards exceeds 21, you lose
              automatically (bust). The player competes against the dealer, and
              the winner is the one who has the hand closest to 21.

            <ul>
              <li><span class="highlight">Ace (A)</span> is worth 1.</li>
              <li>
                <span class="highlight">Face cards (King, Queen, Jack)</span>
                are worth 10.

              <li>
                <span class="highlight">Number cards (2-10)</span> are worth
                their face value.

          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>3. The Deal</h3>
            <p>
              Both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards at the
              beginning of the round. The player's cards are shown face-up. The
              dealer's cards are dealt with one face-up and one face-down card
              (the "hole" card).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>4. Player's Turn</h3>
            <p>The player has the option to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="highlight">Hit:</span> Take another card to
                increase the hand value.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="highlight">Stand:</span> Keep the current hand and
                end the player's turn.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The player can hit multiple times, but if the total value of the
              hand exceeds 21, the player busts and loses the round.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>5. Dealer's Turn</h3>
            <p>
              After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card
              (hole card). The dealer will always draw until their hand value is
              at least 17. If the dealer busts (goes over 21), the player wins
              automatically.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>6. Winning the Game</h3>
            <p>The player wins if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Their hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand.</li>
              <li>The dealer busts (goes over 21).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The dealer wins if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The dealer’s hand value is closer to 21 than the player’s hand.
              </li>
              <li>The player busts (goes over 21).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If both the player and the dealer have the same hand value, the
              round results in a push (a tie), and the player’s bet is returned.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Blackjack</h3>
            <p>
              When the sum of cards of the player is equal to 21, we say it's a
              <span class="highlight">Blackjack</span>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>8. Betting</h3>
            <p>
              The player must place a bet before the round begins. The minimum
              and maximum bet limits are defined. If the player wins, they
              receive the amount equal to their bet. If the player loses, they
              lose their bet amount. If the player ties with the dealer, their
              bet is returned.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="rule-section">
            <h3>9. Game Restart</h3>
            <p>
              Once a round is complete (win, loss, or push), the game can be
              restarted. The player can choose to place a new bet for the next
              round.
